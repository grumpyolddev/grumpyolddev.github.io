For this post I wanted to share some thoughts on a popular book about Lean. **Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit by Mary Poppendieck, Tom Poppendieck**.

Saturn, a Roman mythological character, was famous for eating its own children upon their births... In many ways the Software industry behaves as Saturn. 

This industry changes at the speed of the thought! Every second it generates new vibrant ideas, and at the same point of time it eats and disposes the ideas that claimed to be the next big thing a little while ago...

Software development processes are not the exception. Not so long ago everyone was excited about Agile, Agility or whatever you want to call it now. We loved **daily stand-ups**, **backlogs**, **stories** (written in this way: *'As a User I want this, so I can...'* because we have to be able to see the **'Business Value'** right?). We liked **grooming**, **planning** and **tasking meetings** for every **sprint**.

Everyone started to talk about how agile we were. We started to hear Agile this and Agile that... We spoke about what Agile meant to us, which by the way has a different definition to everyone. Then, we realized everything was doomed when we started looking for ***'Agile Coaches'***, that have never written a line of code in a long time or maybe never... Finally, we had to be Scrum Masters, of course, we had to pay training courses, certifications and memberships to the Agile community...

I believe **Scrum** is a great improvement from the **Waterfall** world we used to live in. However, I strongly believe that **Lean** is the natural progression of the software development methodologies, even when I know that we eventually will overuse this word and will start looking for Lean gurus that show us **'the right path'**.

Ok, it is time to talk about the book! My apologies for the outburst, I tend to get passionate about this!

This book gives not only a good introduction about The ***'Lean Thinking'***, but it is full of real life experiences and evidences that supports every assumption or strong statement made.

Lean has its origins in the car manufacturing industry, which shares many problems with the Software Development industry. It explores the concept of “Lean Thinking” and expands its principles and tools. Such as:

**Eliminate Waste**, Basically anything that does not add any value to the customer is considered Waste. e.g. Extra Processes, Extra Features, Time spent waiting for something to be done, etc. This concept is one of the main differences with the traditional Software Development Processes. Even the Agile ones, like Scrum, because it considers meetings and backlogs as waste, and thus something to be minimized.

**Increase Feedback**, You will increase your productivity by developing software in Iterations with refactoring instead of trying to “Do It Right the First Time”, as most of the traditional methodologies suggests. The explanation to this is because experimentation is cheaper and leads to build knowledge faster. Instead of building a big module at once, try to build the most important features first and deliver them to your customers. It's hard to say, but if you are not delivering features, every iteration, to your customers, you are not being Lean enough... It is all about fast Feedback!!
Finally, keep in mind that an iteration should be considered as a possible solution, not the final one!

**Decide as Late as Possible**, Traditional wisdom about software development suggests that we need to define most of the things up front. Such as: languages, frameworks and databases. The problem with this is that this approach narrows your horizon, makes you rigid, and it is easy to take wrong decisions. You are imposing yourself high constraints upfront! The book defines this approach as **'depth-first'**. In Lean thinking you try to do **'breadth-first'** instead. It means, after you have a high level design, you start developing. This encourages the design to emerge through iterations, and leads us to take better decisions in the long term.

**Deliver as fast as possible**, the book focuses to use the queue theory concepts to deliver software as fast as possible! It focuses to reduce the **'Cycle Time'**, which is the time to takes something to be processed in a queue. To achieve this, it suggests reducing the size of the **'work package'** because it encourages parallel processing. However, this may reveal bottlenecks on your process, like testers being overflowed with features to test. The future bottlenecks need to be fixed in order to reduce the Cycle Time of your development pipeline.

**Empower the Team**, Tailor your process to benefit the ***'front line workers'***. By improving their lives, you will improve the quality of the product delivered. It also encourages to improve the creativity and innovation of your product. Lean thinking relies on **self-organized** teams that are not afraid to tell their managers how to let them do their jobs.

**Avoid a Disciplined Process**, Organizations tend to establish standardized processes in order to improve results and consistency. The problem is that we end up with heavy processes which leads to local optimizations instead of a global one. It often tends to create more documentation or detailed planning, which will reduce your feedback. In Lean thinking you will reduce waste by increase the feedback, not reducing it!

**I'm excited! How can I start?**

Well, Lean focuses on reducing waste! You can start identifying Waste by creating, by hand, a **Value Stream Map** of your current development process, then start attacking the biggest bottlenecks.

Then, you can improve your programming environment to include: Automated build process: Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Automated testing (end to end, component, integration, performance), version control.
Start building software in Iterations. Demo every piece of work built to your peers, not only at the end of the Iteration. More importantly, start delivering software in iterations. Software that is not being used by final users is Waste!!

Improve your environment by creating a space where everyone can see the goal of the current iteration, what has been done, what is in progress, and what has to be done. Put in place Information radiators to make problems visible!

Personally, this book is a must read for everyone interested in writing software in a better/faster way. Easy to read and well balanced for technical a non-technical audience.

My biggest take away is the reality check about where we are in the path of being **'Lean'**.

Saturn feared that his children would one day overthrow him. For sure that will happen to Lean, but until that happens I'll keep believing that Lean is the natural progression of the Software Development processes.   

I hope you enjoy reading this book as I did!
