###My first post on the Dairy of a Grumpy Old Dev!


My name is Ramses Vejar and if I would have to define myself in one sentence, I would describe me as a Grumpy old Dev! Always passionate about technology, most of the time opinionated and biased, but above all: open for new, and hopefully, disruptive ideas!

After a long, long time I decide to write about one of the things that I'm most passionate about: Software Development.

I have spent, invested, most of my ride (as a Developer, architect, teacher, but most of the time as a learner of this challenging industry) with Java and working on Web applications for small, medium and large companies/projects.

I have to admit that the more time I work in this industry, the more I feel I need to learn about it. And that's the beauty of this career: it keeps your mind busy and the blood running trying to keep up and absorb all the information that comes out every day.

Every day we all read and and listen new, and often old, ideas, "paradigms", languages, patterns, and strategies about how to write software. And personally, how to write better software to make people's life easier!

For me, you do not retire from this industry, it retires you! This and my passion about software development are the reasons why I decide to write about my experiences on this "business".

Personally, I DO NOT pretend to teach anything to anyone, but on the contrary, to learn and expose my biased opinion about the topics that I am interested in.

So, what am I interested about? Well, I have to say that I have changed my interests many times along this ride. And as a good friend once told me: "Do not fall in love with your tools" and I would rephrase it: Do not fall in love with your languages, frameworks, methodologies, and especially on your own ideas! I would say that my Interests includes (but are not limited to):

- Programming Languages (Especially Jvm and Js flavours)
- Web and Mobile development
- Functional programming (currently loving Clojure and trying to get over Scala... It's you not me!) 
- Software Development Methodologies (Lean please!)
- Architectures (currently interested in Microservices, but I hate the overuse of this word!!)
- Automation
- Patterns
- Open source

Additionally, I have been working in a couple of personal projects that I would like to write about, and most important to receive feedback from people who has similar interests as me!

Exposing myself online will motivate me to write more often and to be more committed to my personal interests and projects.


I expect to write twice a month (hopefull)! Thanks for reading my first post and I hope to hear from you as well!


Thanks and see you around!
